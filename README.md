# A Website by Trace DeLange
## A rough, rough draft of what will maybe someday soon be my professional software blog/portfolio

Some of the features of the site:
- Original HTML layout
- Original CSS styling
- Implementation of two different examples of DOM event listeners by linking JavaScript
- A navbar link and header that I'm kind of proud of, considering I've attempted to make both of those things in Flask dozens of times in the past.
